# Focus App

The Focus App is a Java-based productivity tool designed to help users manage tasks and improve focus through effective time management techniques. The main functionalities of the app include task management and the Pomodoro timer. I wrote an article about it [here](https://danishmohammed57.medium.com/i-made-a-focus-productivity-app-b49195430417)
